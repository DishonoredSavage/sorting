# Sorting
Various sorting algorithms applied to arrays of pseudo-randomly generated integers.  The integers in the arrays are represented by rectangles of height proportional to the size of the integer.  The x-coordinate of each rectangle corresponds to the index of the integer it represents.

Worst-case running times of the sorting algorithms currently implemented:
- Bubble sort - O($n^2$)
- Insertion sort - O($n^2$)
- Selection sort - O($n^2$)
- Merge sort - O($nlogn$)
